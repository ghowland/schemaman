## DirDB

DirDB is a directory based database.  Created for storing and sharing configuration data, not large amounts of records which directories are traditionally not good at dealing with.

Directory databases can easily be worked with in any environment, as every major OS supports directories and files, and using SchemaMan these can have their schema maintained in sync with traditional relational or key-value databases.
