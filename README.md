# SchemaMan


SchemaMan is a schema manager for multiple databases, so that schema confguration can be stored in meta data files, and applied equally to any database.

SchemaMan can be used as a generic wrapper for working with databases, or migrating data between databases, who have SchemaMan schemas defined.

The focus of SchemaMan is on smaller low-volume data sets, such as found in System or Network Configuration management systems.
